# This Graph.c is essentially the Graph.c in pa4, just modified slightly.
# The comments may have been edited, I did not change any of the common methods.
#
# Supprisingly I actually finished and debugged the whole program before the hard
# deadline this time. I did need the one day extension, I got help in the lab that
# Monday the 28th. I was able to figure out most of the errors without any help.
# Again, many of my errors with this project stemmed from unfound/ unsolved problems
# in my List ADT. It was a little tricky at first figuring out how to implemement DFS()
# especially making the stack work properly and figuring out how to pass time to Vist().
# The memory leaks I dealt with really made me question how I was indexing my List. I
# actually re-read the pa2 project description to double check I had everything correct.
#
# This is kind of a story more than anything...
# My pa4 wasn't working properly when I turned it in. So I went to lab
# the day after it was due and was able to work out the memory leak in the Graph. The
# guy gave me some solid programming advice. He told me that if I stared at a computer
# for too long trying to find a bug in the code that after 2-3 hours you can't see the
# bug anymore; you have to take breaks and come back to problems you are unable to solve.
# That really helped reduce my stress while debugging and I think that advice was worth
# getting a 75/100 on pa4. I'm glad that I've made mistakes this quarter. I've really
# learned a lot from them. It has given me all the more reason to try harder and rise
# to the challenges I face.

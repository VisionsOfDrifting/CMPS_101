# CMPS 101

Algorithms and Abstract Data Types

Completed at UC Santa Cruz
Summer Quarter 2016

The course builds on itself. The list you create in project 2 
becomes the adjacency list you implement in project 4 and 5.

There was an additional challenge project at the end of the 
class, Pa6, you are to make a similar impementation of Pa5
except implementing a heap and running dijkstra's algorithm
instead of breadth/depth first search. I aspire to finish 
that sometime soon.

#   I'm experiencing memory issues with the list ADT.
# I'm sure these are issues left over from pa2,
# I've tried to my best ability to find the error, but
# nothing I do seems to work. With the extra day on the
# assignment I collaborated with peers and went to the
# lab. Neither my peers nor the lab assistant could help
# me with the issue. I mannaged to issolate the error as
# an issue with my freeList() calling deleteFront(). I 
# rewrote the method a couple of different ways, first
# using my pa3 version and translating it in to C.
# After that didn't seem to work the lab assistant tried
# to help correct the method I was using originally, but
# we still could not fix the memory leaks.
#
# I am giving up trying to solve the memory leaks in my
# list because I have made little if any progress in 36 
# hours even with help and I do not think that it is
# worth anymore time. I will take the grade that I get.
#
# I'm submitting this acknowledging that it doesn't work,
# but this is all of the code that I wrote. And I believe
# that the methods I have written for the current 
# assignment are sound.
